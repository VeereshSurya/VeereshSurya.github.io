          <p>
            Hello, and thank you for visiting my website! I’m Veeresh Surya C, 26 years old, from Gundasagar, 
            a small village in Karnataka, India. My family includes my father, my wife, and me. My father is 
            a farmer, and my wife is a full-time YouTube Vlogger. I also have two older sisters who are both 
            married.
          </p>

          <p>
            I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science in 2020 from the Government Sri Krishna 
            Rajendra Silver Jubilee Technological Institute, affiliated with Vishveshvaraiah Technological University, 
            Belagavi. My dream of becoming a software engineer began in high school. My curiosity about Internet 
            technology and computers inspired me to pursue this field. During college, I developed a passion for coding, 
            actively participating in essay, poetry, and quiz competitions and winning awards.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond coding, I have a creative side. I’ve written over 25 poems in Kannada literature, exploring themes like 
            love, life, womanhood, society, poverty, and hunger. I was also a district executive member of 
            <a href="https://aidso.in/">AIDSO</a> (All India Democratic Students' Organisation), which demands scientific, 
            secular, and democratic education for all. I love to travel and capture the beauty of new places through photography. 
            During my free time, I join my wife in creating vlogs, combining our passion for exploration with storytelling.

        <h2 class="text-center">My Journey as a Poet</h2>
        <p class="p-journey">
          Writing has always been a way for me to express my feelings, whether it’s joy, sorrow, likes, dislikes, or even 
          failures and lessons learned. Most of the time, I would write down my emotions and experiences in a personal diary. 
          There were moments when those around me couldn’t fully understand my feelings, and that’s when I turned to my pen 
          and paper to share my thoughts. This practice of writing about my feelings, the people I love, and the events or 
          situations that deeply affected me—such as slum areas in Bangalore, children dying from hunger, and the difficulties 
          poor people face in obtaining basic needs—became a regular part of my life. Over the years, I’ve written more than 
          25 poems on topics such as love, life, women, hunger, poverty, and much more.
        </p>

        <p class="p-journey">
          Like many poets, I have always wanted my work to be read by others and to touch people’s hearts. 
          This desire led me to share my poems here on my website. While all of the poems are currently in Kannada, 
          I plan to add English translations soon so they can reach a wider audience. If you understand Kannada, 
          I invite you to explore my poetry, and if my words speak to you, please take a moment to read.

          <h2 class="text-center">My Interests and Desires</h2>
          <p>
            In my free time, I find joy in listening to music, and I write poems when I feel deeply inspired. I have a passion 
            for exploring nature and capturing its beauty through photography to create lasting memories. I also enjoy playing 
            cricket and have participated in and won local tournaments in my village and company.
          </p>

          <p>
            When it comes to my dreams and goals, my heart often turns toward the reality many people face in our country. 
            Even after 76 years of independence, many are still struggling to access basic needs like education, food, shelter, 
            and healthcare. We see examples of this in the slums of cities like Mumbai and Bangalore, where children have to 
            leave school to work, collecting plastics or doing odd jobs to help feed their families. It’s a cycle that limits 
            their potential and deprives them of a fair chance in life.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a humble human being, I cannot let my heart rest without doing something for those in need. I am committed 
            to finding ways to help these communities, starting with initiatives that bring education and nutrition to those 
            in need. My hope is to use modern technology to reach as many people as possible and make a meaningful impact on 
            their lives. India ranked 111th out of 125 countries in the 2023 Global Hunger Index, highlighting the urgent 
            need to address hunger and other basic needs.
